Ever euthanized:
Abe's family growing up has had to put down several dogs for age reasons (combination of dementia, blindness, incontinence and inability to locomote)

In case of bite:
Separate them. Ensure that the person was alright. Figure out what precipitated the event. Ensure that the situation won't arise again.
There really is very little else to say without knowing the specifics. For all the dogs I've ever had, I would honestly say that they were probably /severely/ provoked.
