  <p class="ep"><em class="calibre2">“When we no longer have good cooking in the world, we will have no literature, nor high and sharp intelligence, nor friendly gatherings, nor social harmony.”</em></p>

  <p class="eps"><strong class="calibre1">— MARIE-ANTOINE CARÊME, CHEF (1784–1833)</strong></p>

  <p class="ep"><em class="calibre2">“Good cooking is an art, as well as a form of intense pleasure. . . . A recipe is only a theme, which an intelligent cook can play each time with a variation.”</em></p>

  <p class="eps"><strong class="calibre1">— MADAME JEHANE BENOÎT, CHEF (1904–1987)</strong></p>

  <p class="ep"><em class="calibre2">“You have to love either what you are going to eat, or the person you are cooking for. Then you have to give yourself up to cooking. Cuisine is an act of love.”</em></p>

  <p class="eps"><strong class="calibre1">— ALAIN CHAPEL, CHEF (1937–1990)</strong></p>

  <p class="crt2">The first quotation suggests why we do what we do, while the others suggest how. We published our first book in 1995, and it is exciting as we approach the publication of <em class="calibre2">The Flavor Bible</em> in 2008 to witness the realm of good cooking as it reaches a new “tipping point.”</p>

  <p class="calibre6">No longer content simply to replicate others’ recipes, today’s cooks — professionals and amateurs alike — increasingly seek to create their own dishes. In doing so, they celebrate the creative <em class="calibre2">process</em> of cooking as much as the finished <em class="calibre2">product</em>.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">Cooking at its most basic level is a creative act, one of transforming food through the application of heat and the incorporation of other ingredients. But there are different orders of creativity, and merely following a recipe is a creative act of the most basic order, like painting by numbers.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">When accomplished cooks grow restless, they start to analyze instructions before following them to see if they can improve upon the results, thus raising the act of cooking to a creative act of a higher order. As their experience grows, cooks are able to bring greater intuition and even inspiration to their cooking.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">Traditional cookbooks are aimed at first-order cooks. Every cook owes a debt of gratitude to those who have brought progress to cuisine throughout history — those who famously codified classic cuisines through the painstaking chronicling of recipes, from Auguste Escoffier in France to others around the globe. Appreciation is also due to those who have elevated and expanded the range of available ingredients and techniques, the essential building blocks of cooking.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">Over the years, cookbooks have come to dictate precise measurement of ingredients along with instructions for their preparation and assembly, which has done much to improve the general accessibility of recipes. However, they also have come to provide a false sense of security for which the unsuspecting cook pays a price. When a recipe is rigidly scripted and blindly followed, it negates the cook’s own creative instincts and good judgment — not to mention much of the pleasure of truly “being” in the moment.</p>

  <p class="ep"><em class="calibre2">“Great cooks rarely bother to consult cookbooks.”</em></p>

  <p class="eps"><strong class="calibre1">— CHARLES SIMIC, U.S. POET LAUREATE</strong></p>

  <p class="crt2">Those with the urge to innovate had long been on their own in the kitchen until many adopted our 1996 book, <em class="calibre2">Culinary Artistry</em>, as their muse. That book sought to break the mold of contemporary prescriptive cookbooks and to restore the creative instinct to chefs. Drawing on classic flavor combinations and preparations, it put the wisdom of history at cooks’ fingertips for the first time — and with the same ease with which writers consulted a thesaurus.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">As time passed, it became clear that chefs were thinking of flavors and their combination in new ways, beyond the classics chronicled in <em class="calibre2">Culinary Artistry.</em> Meanwhile, the gap between professionals and amateur cooks narrowed, as the latter installed Viking ranges at home to prepare a burgeoning array of new ingredients, with their TVs transformed into virtual twenty-four-hour cooking schools, given the advent of culinary programming.</p>

  <p class="ep"><em class="calibre2">“Food without wine is a corpse; wine without food is a ghost. United and well matched, they are as body and soul: living partners.”</em></p>

  <p class="eps"><strong class="calibre1">— ANDRÉ SIMON, CHEF (1877–1970)</strong></p>

  <p class="crt2">Since the year 2000 we have been studying the new ways in which flavors are being combined. It has been a privilege to interview many of the country’s most imaginative chefs and other food and drink experts (turning to an entirely different lineup from those we spoke to for <em class="calibre2">Culinary Artistry</em>). Some are well-established industry pioneers, while others have risen on the scene in recent years. All have wowed us with their savory cuisines and/or desserts, and often in spots less traveled, from Dallas to New Orleans to Hoboken. We’ve also combed the most recent culinary literature published in 2000 or later.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">The first result was our 2006 book, <em class="calibre2">What to Drink with What You Eat,</em> which celebrated the harmonious combination of food and drink and, indeed, their inseparability, as suggested by the André Simon quotation.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">The second result is <em class="calibre2">The Flavor Bible</em>, which, like <em class="calibre2">Culinary Artistry</em>, is not intended to be prescriptive; rather, it is an empowerment tool. <em class="calibre2">The Flavor Bible</em> is a comprehensive, easy-to-use single-volume reference of more than six hundred alphabetical entries listing modern-day compatible flavors, chronicling new flavor synergies in the new millennium.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">Our books <em class="calibre2">Culinary Artistry</em> (classic flavor combinations before 1996), <em class="calibre2">The Flavor Bible</em> (modern flavor combinations since 2000), and <em class="calibre2">What to Drink with What You Eat</em> (classic and modern food and drink combinations) are essential to use in concert, as each covers different aspects of food and drink flavor harmony.</p>

  <p class="crt2">We believe cooking will continue to evolve, and not only as a means of “doing” (i.e., putting dinner on the table, or “problem-solving” by “following a recipe”). Over time, we believe more people — including, perhaps, yourself — will have discovered it as a way of “being” in the world. We have learned enough over the past decade or two to question why cooking is done one way versus another. This thoughtful sensory engagement leads to a store of experiences that allow us to bring more intuition to the cooking process, synthesizing what we’ve done before into innovative approaches to creating a dish. Ultimately, cooking offers the opportunity to be immersed in one’s senses and in the moment like no other activity, uniting the inner and outer selves. At these times, cooking transcends drudgery and becomes a means of meditation and even healing.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">It is little surprise to us, then, that when U.S. Poet Laureate Charles Simic was asked by the <em class="calibre2">New York Times Magazine’</em>s Deborah Solomon earlier this year, “What advice would you give to people who are looking to be happy?” his response was “For starters, learn how to cook.”</p>

  <p class="calibre6">We hope this book makes you happy — literally.</p>
