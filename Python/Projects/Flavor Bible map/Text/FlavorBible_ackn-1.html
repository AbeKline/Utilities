  <p class="ep1"><em class="calibre2">“We don’t accomplish anything in this world alone . . . and whatever happens is the result of the whole tapestry of one’s life and all the weavings of individual threads from one to another that creates something.”</em></p>

  <p class="exts">— SANDRA DAY O’CONNOR</p>

  <p class="crt2">We’d like to thank some of the many people whose invaluable threads helped to create the tapestry that is <em class="calibre2">The Flavor Bible.</em></p>

  <p class="calibre6">First and foremost are all the experts who took the time to speak with us at length about the way they approach flavor development and innovation — and whose insights in this book will surely inspire the next generation to new heights of creativity in the kitchen.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">At Little, Brown, thanks to our editor, Michael L. Sand, whose advice and counsel we are both lucky and grateful to have had leading this team. He was not only a trusted sounding board for editorial issues, but his great taste extends from his keen eye overseeing this book’s gorgeous design to our delectable lunches at restaurants including Alto and Park Avenue Winter.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">We’d also like to thank the other fabulous folks at Little, Brown, including Sophie Cottrell, vice president and Hachette communications director; Michael Pietsch, publisher; Carolyn O’Keefe and Luisa Frontino, publicists; Peggy Freudenthal, Jayne Yaffe Kemp, and Julie Stillman, copy editors; Jean Wilcox, designer; and Zinzi Clemmons, editorial assistant. Thanks, too, to Karen Murgolo and Jill Cohen, our acquiring editor and publisher, for kicking things off.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">Many thanks to our inimitable literary agent Janis Donnaud of Janis A. Donnaud and Associates, for sharing her wisdom and her own delicious taste in everything from publisher matchmaking to Moroccan tagines to barbecued spareribs.</p>

  <p class="crt2">Photography: Our heartfelt thanks to our photographer and very dear friend, the multitalented Barry Salzman, who created the extraordinary photography for this book. Barry traveled all over to get the right shot and even supplied his own home as a studio. We join Barry in extending thanks to all of the restaurants (and professionals, plus their staffs) who were enormously helpful to us in setting up the photo shoots. They include: August (Tony Liu), A Voce (Dante Camara), Babbo (Gina DePalma), Bette (Amy Sacco), Casaville (Lahcen Ksiyer), Chikalicious (Chika and Don Tillman), Chinatown Brasserie, Darna (Mourad El-Hebil), Despaña, DiPalo, Essex Street Market, Fairway Market, Formaggio Essex, Gilt (Tobie Cancino), Inside (Charleen Badman and Anne Rosenzweig), Kalustyan’s (Aziz Osmani), La Esquina, Maremma (Cesare Casella), Saxelby Cheesemongers (Anne Saxelby), Solera (Ron Miller), and the Modern (Gabriel Kreuther).</p>

  <p class="crt2">Virtual Book Tour: We wouldn’t have had as much fun introducing our last book, <em class="calibre2">What to Drink with What You</em><em class="calibre2">Eat,</em> to the world if it hadn’t been for the overwhelmingly warm support of the Web sites and blogs who agreed to host a stop on our Virtual Book Tour in October 2006.

And a special thank-you to Barbara-jo McIntosh of Barbara-Jo’s Books to Cooks in Vancouver, Ellen Rose of the Cook’s Library in Los Angeles, and Nach Waxman of Kitchen Arts &amp; Letters in New York City, whose stores are specialty treasures.</p>

  <p class="crt2">Thornton Wilder wrote, “We can only be said to be alive in those moments when our hearts are conscious of our treasures.” As we think of those who have been there for us with such generosity, we feel very much alive indeed.</p>

  <p class="crt2">— ANDREW DORNENBURG AND KAREN PAGE<br class="calibre13"/>
  April 2008</p>

  <p class="crt2">P.S. from Andrew Dornenburg: <em class="calibre2">The Flavor Bible</em> is our first book with Karen’s name listed first on the cover, even though she has always been the prime conceptualizer and writer of all of them. Karen generously suggested before our first book came out in 1995 that we list our names alphabetically — a tradition that continued more out of publishing convenience (having all our books alphabetized together on bookstore shelves, for example) than anything else. However, she is long overdue to be properly credited as the primary force behind our work together. I couldn’t be happier about the change!</p>
