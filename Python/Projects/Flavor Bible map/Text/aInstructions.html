<p class="calibre6">When perusing the listings of compatible flavors, readers of our book <em class="calibre2">What to Drink with What You Eat</em> will recognize our ranking system to let you know which pairings are truly stellar. Those ingredients that appear in <strong class="calibre1">BOLD CAPS</strong> with an asterisk (*) are ethereal, time-honored classics: these “marriages made in heaven” comprise the top 1 or 2 percent of pairings. Next we have very highly recommended pairings in <strong class="calibre1">BOLD CAPS. Bold,</strong> noncapitalized listings are frequently recommended pairings; and plain text pairings are recommended pairings. But remember: Even when just a single top expert recommends a flavor combination, it’s very high praise indeed.</p>
