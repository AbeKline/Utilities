  <p class="ep1"><em class="calibre2">Magical dishes, magical words: A great cook is, when all is said and done, a great poet. . . . For was it not a visit from the Muses that inspired the person who first had the idea of marrying rice and chicken, grape and thrush, potatoes and entrecôte, Parmesan and pasta, eggplant and tomato, Chambertin and cockerel, liqueur brandy and woodcock, onion and tripe?</em></p>

  <p class="eps1">— MARCEL E. GRANCHER, <em class="calibre2">CINQUANTE ANS À TABLE</em> (1953)</p>

  <p class="sbh"><strong class="calibre1">FLAVOR = TASTE + MOUTHFEEL + AROMA + “THE X FACTOR”</strong></p>

  <p class="sbul"><strong class="calibre1">Taste</strong> = What is perceived by the taste buds</p>

  <p class="sbul1"><strong class="calibre1">Mouthfeel</strong> = What is perceived by the rest of the mouth</p>

  <p class="sbul1"><strong class="calibre1">Aroma</strong> = What is perceived by the nose</p>

  <p class="sbul2"><strong class="calibre1">“The X Factor”</strong> = What is perceived by the other senses — plus the heart, mind, and spirit</p>

  <p class="crt2">Our taste buds can perceive only four basic tastes: sweet, salty, sour, and bitter. The essence of great cooking is to bring these four tastes into balanced harmony to create deliciousness. It’s that simple — and that difficult. After all, flavor is a function not only of taste, but also of smell, touch, sight, and sound. Because we’re human beings, other nonphysical factors come into play, including our emotions, thoughts, and spirits.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">Learning to recognize as well as manipulate both the obvious and subtle components of flavor will make you a much better cook. This book will be your companion in the kitchen whenever you wish to create deliciousness.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">Learning to cook like a great chef is within the realm of possibility. However, it is something that is rarely taught; it must be “caught.”</p>

  <p class="calibre6">Everyone who cooks — or even merely seasons their food at the table before eating — can benefit from mastering the basic principles of making food taste great. This complex subject is simplified by one thing: while the universe may contain a vast number of ingredients and a virtually infinite number of ingredient combinations, the palate can register only the four basic tastes.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">Great food balances these tastes beautifully. A great cook knows how to taste, to discern what is needed, and to make adjustments. Once you learn how to season and how to balance tastes, a whole new world opens up to you in cooking. Of course, several factors conspire against your ever doing so — not the least of which is a culture that sees the publication of thousands of new cookbooks annually featuring recipes that promise to dazzle you and your guests if you follow them to the letter. And yet you’re often left wondering why the results aren’t as delicious as promised. That’s because great cooking is never as simple as merely following a recipe. The best cooking requires a discerning palate to know when a dish needs a little something or other — and what to add or do to elevate its flavor.</p>

  <p class="h">WHAT IS PERCEIVED BY THE MOUTH</p>

  <p class="h1">Taste Buds</p>

  <p class="crt2">Sweetness. Saltiness. Sourness. Bitterness. Every delicious bite you’ve ever tasted has been a result of these four tastes coming together on your taste buds. We taste them as individual notes, and in concert. Each taste affects the other. For example, bitterness suppresses sweetness. In addition, different tastes affect us in different ways. Saltiness stimulates the appetite, while sweetness satiates it. Take the time to explore the four basic tastes.</p>

  <p class="crt2"><strong class="calibre1">Sweetness</strong></p>

  <p class="crt2">It takes the greatest quantity of a substance that is sweet (versus salty, sour, or bitter) to register on our taste buds. However, we can appreciate the balance and “roundness” that even otherwise imperceptible sweetness adds to savory dishes. Sweetness can work with bitterness, sourness — even saltiness. Sweetness can also bring out the flavors of other ingredients, from fruits to mint.</p>

  <p class="crt2"><strong class="calibre1">Saltiness</strong></p>

  <p class="crt2">When we banished more than thirty of America’s leading chefs to their own desert islands with only ten ingredients to cook with for the rest of their lives (<em class="calibre2">Culinary Artistry</em>, 1996), the number-one ingredient they chose was salt. Salt is nature’s flavor enhancer. It is the single most important taste for making savory food delicious. (Sweetness, by the way, plays the same role in desserts.)</p>

  <p class="crt2"><strong class="calibre1">Sourness</strong></p>

  <p class="crt2">Sourness is second only to salt in savory food and sugar in sweet food in its importance as a flavor enhancer. Sour notes — whether a squeeze of lemon or a drizzle of vinegar — add sparkle and brightness to a dish. Balancing a dish’s acidity with its other tastes is critical to the dish’s ultimate success.</p>

  <p class="crt2"><strong class="calibre1">Bitterness</strong></p>

  <p class="crt2">Humans are most sensitive to bitterness, and our survival wiring allows us to recognize it in even relatively tiny amounts. Bitterness balances sweetness, and can also play a vital role in cutting richness in a dish. While bitterness is more important to certain people than to others, some chefs see it as an indispensable “cleansing” taste — one that makes you want to take the next bite, and the next.</p>

  <p class="crt2"><strong class="calibre1"><em class="calibre2">Umami</em> (Savoriness)</strong></p>

  <p class="crt2">In addition to the four basic tastes, there is growing evidence of a fifth taste, <em class="calibre2">umami</em>, which we first wrote about in 1996 in <em class="calibre2">Culinary Artistry</em>. It is often described as the savory or meaty “mouth-filling” taste that is noticeable in such ingredients as anchovies, blue cheese, mushrooms, and green tea, and in such flavorings as monosodium glutamate (MSG), which is the primary component of branded seasonings such as Ac´cent.</p>

  <p class="h1">Mouthfeel</p>

  <p class="crt2">In addition to its sense of taste, the mouth has a sense of “touch” and can register other sensations, such as temperature and texture, that all play a role in flavor. These aspects of food, generally characterized as mouthfeel, help to bring food into alignment with our bodies, and bring some of a dish’s greatest interest and pleasure. The crunchiness and crispiness of a dish contribute sound as well as textural appeal.</p>

  <p class="crt2"><strong class="calibre1">Temperature</strong></p>

  <p class="crt2"><em class="calibre2">I always pay attention to temperature. I look at what I feel like eating now. If it is cold and rainy outside, I make sure that soup is on the menu. If it is hot outside, I make sure there are lots of salads on the menu.</em></p>

  <p class="ca"><strong class="calibre1">— ANDREW CARMELLINI,</strong> A VOCE (NEW YORK CITY)</p>

  <p class="crt2">Temperature is one of the foremost among the other sensations that can be perceived by the mouth. The temperature of our food even affects our perception of its taste; for example, coldness suppresses sweetness. Boston pastry chef Rick Katz, with whom Andrew cooked at Lydia Shire’s restaurant Biba, first taught him the lesson of pulling out the ice cream a few minutes before serving so that the slight rise in temperature could maximize its flavor.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">A food’s temperature can affect both the perception and enjoyment of a dish. A chilled carrot soup on a hot summer day — and hot roasted carrots on a cold winter day — could be said to be “healing” through their ability to bring our bodies into greater alignment with our environment.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="art" src="../Images/Art_P0xvi.jpg" class="calibre3"/></p>

  <p class="crt2"><strong class="calibre1">Texture</strong></p>

  <p class="crt2"><em class="calibre2">I would never serve pike on a base of chowder, because balance and texture are so important when it comes to creating a dish. Is there a rich component, a lean component, a crunchy component, and a cleansing component? Are all the taste sensors activated so that you want to go back for a second bite? Cod works better over a richer preparation like chowder. I would also make sure to choose the right technique for the cod: I would not poach it, because if it is poached it would be silky on silky. If it is seared, it is crunchy on silky — which is more appealing because of the contrast.</em></p>

  <p class="ca"><strong class="calibre1">— SHARON HAGE,</strong> YORK STREET (DALLAS)</p>

  <p class="crt2">A food’s texture is central to its ability to captivate and to please. We value pureed and/or creamy foods (such as soups and mashed potatoes) as “comfort” foods, and crunchiness and crispiness (such as nachos and caramel corn) as “fun” foods. We enjoy texture as it activates our other senses, including touch, sight, and sound.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">While babies by necessity eat pureed foods, most adults enjoy a variety of textures, particularly crispiness and crunchiness, which break up the smoothness of texture — or even the simple monotony — of dishes.</p>

  <p class="crt2"><strong class="calibre1">Piquancy</strong></p>

  <p class="crt2">Our mouths can also sense what we often incorrectly refer to as “hotness,” meaning piquancy’s “sharpness” and/or “spiciness” — whether boldly as in chile peppers, or more subtly as in a sprinkle of cayenne pepper. Some people find the experience of these <em class="calibre2">picante</em> (as the Spanish refer to it, or <em class="calibre2">piccante</em> as the Italians do) tastes more pleasurable than others.</p>

  <p class="crt2"><strong class="calibre1">Astringency</strong></p>

  <p class="crt2">Our mouths “pucker” to register astringency. This is a drying sensation caused by the tannins in red wine or strong tea, and occasionally in foods such as walnuts, cranberries, and unripe persimmons.</p>

  <p class="h">WHAT IS PERCEIVED BY THE NOSE</p>

  <p class="h1">Aroma</p>

  <p class="crt2">Aroma is thought to be responsible for as much as 80 percent or more of flavor. This helps to explain the popularity of aromatic ingredients, from fresh herbs and spices to grated lemon zest. Incorporating aromatic ingredients can enhance the aroma of your dish and, in turn, its flavor.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">Some qualities are perceived through both the sense of taste and smell, such as:</p>

  <p class="crt2"><strong class="calibre1">Pungency</strong></p>

  <p class="crt2">Pungency refers to the taste and aroma of such ingredients as horseradish and mustard that are as irritating — albeit often pleasantly — to the nose as they are to the palate.</p>

  <p class="crt2"><strong class="calibre1">Chemesthesis</strong></p>

  <p class="crt2">Chemesthesis refers to other sensations that tickle (e.g., the tingle of carbonated beverages) or play tricks on (e.g., the false perception of “heat” from chile peppers, or “cold” from peppermint) our gustatory senses.</p>

  <p class="sbh"><strong class="calibre1">Heightening Flavor with Dominique and Cindy Duby of Wild Sweets</strong></p>

  <p class="ep1"><em class="calibre2">We believe that food preparation is 60 percent ingredients and 40 percent technique.</em></p>

  <p class="eps1"><strong class="calibre1">— DOMINIQUE AND CINDY DUBY,</strong> WILD SWEETS (VANCOUVER)</p>

  <p class="sbul">Flavor is the combination of the taste you experience on your tongue and the aroma you experience through your nose. We believe that as much as 90 percent of what we perceive as taste is actually aroma. When you eat a pineapple, the flavor really comes through the nose. So, if your pineapple is not ripe, it won’t have much aroma. It may taste sweet, but it won’t taste like pineapple.</p>

  <p class="sbtx">There are two ways to bring flavor to a dish, through aroma or through chemical reaction. We always say that cooking is no different from doing a lab experiment: The minute you add heat to a raw product, you are changing the status of that product. When you use the Maillard reaction — which is what happens when you sear a piece of meat — you are getting a reaction of caramelization from the carbohydrates and amino acids. This chemical reaction creates flavor.</p>

  <p class="sbtx">To add aroma to a dish, think of a piece of fish cooked in broth with herbs or lemon. The problem is that the flavor escapes into the air. If you walk into a room and it smells great, that means there is not much flavor left in the dish. The aroma has escaped. So, if you want to add aroma to a dish, the best way is through <em class="calibre2">sous-vide</em> cooking [which cooks encased food at long, slow temperatures]. This method traps the aroma into what you are cooking without letting it escape.</p>

  <p class="sbtx">The problem is that <em class="calibre2">sous vide</em> is not available for home cooks. What a home cook can do is “sealed cooking,” where you take a heavy-duty freezer zip lock bag, put in what you want to cook with the liquid, then cook it over a steady heat on your stove. Another method that works is putting the bag in a pot with a single-cup water heater that goes to about 140 degrees Fahrenheit and, from time to time, stirring the water. [Note: Care must be taken with this low-temperature method of cooking to avoid food poisoning.]</p>

  <p class="sbtx">This is a way to put — and keep — a lot of flavor in whatever you are cooking.</p>

  <p class="h">WHAT IS PERCEIVED BY THE HEART, MIND, AND SPIRIT</p>

  <p class="h1">“The X Factor”</p>

  <p class="crt2">When we are present to what we are eating, food has the power to affect our entire selves. We experience food not only through our five physical senses — including our sense of sight, which we address first below — but also emotionally, mentally, and even spiritually.</p>

  <p class="sbh"><strong class="calibre1">Compatible Flavors</strong></p>

  <p class="sbul1">An essential aspect of great cooking is harnessing compatible flavors — which involves knowing which herbs, spices, and other flavorings best accentuate particular ingredients.</p>

  <p class="sbtx">A process of trial and error over centuries resulted in classic cuisines and dishes, some of which feature timeless combinations of beloved flavor pairings — for example, basil with tomatoes, rosemary with lamb, and tarragon with lobster.</p>

  <p class="sbtx">However, today it’s possible to use scientific techniques to analyze similar molecular structures to come up with new, compatible pairing possibilities, as odd as some might sound — such as jasmine with pork liver, parsley with banana, or white chocolate with caviar.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="art" src="../Images/Art_Pxviii.jpg" class="calibre3"/></p>

  <p class="crt2"><strong class="calibre1">The Visual</strong></p>

  <p class="crt2">The visual presentation of a dish can greatly enhance the pleasure we derive from it. Just a few decades ago, it was still possible to taste a dish with the eyes, but only those who’d spent time in world-class kitchens knew the tricks of such artistic plate presentation. Since the advent of <em class="calibre2">Art Culinaire</em> and the Web, it’s become easier to reproduce a great dish’s elaborate form than its exquisite flavor.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">How a dish looks can also affect our perception of its flavor in more direct ways; for example, the deeper the color of a berry sorbet, the more berry flavor is perceived. The stronger the connection between a particular food and a particular color, the stronger the flavor impact — such as berries with red, lemon with yellow, and lime with green.</p>

  <p class="crt2"><strong class="calibre1">The Emotional</strong></p>

  <p class="crt2"><em class="calibre2">I say all the time that [my mother’s Spanish potato and egg tortilla] is my favorite because it conveys a point: that sentimental value comes above all else.</em></p>

  <p class="ca"><strong class="calibre1">— FERRAN ADRIA,</strong> EL BULLI (SPAIN)</p>

  <p class="crt2">We taste with our hearts as much as with our tongues. What else could explain adult preferences for one’s mother’s dishes over those prepared by a great chef? This also helps to explain the lasting appeal of traditional dishes and cuisines of countries around the globe, which stem from our love for their cultures, their people, and the deeply rooted culinary traditions that have sustained them over centuries.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="art" src="../Images/Art_P0xix.jpg" class="calibre3"/></p>

  <p class="crt2"><strong class="calibre1">The Mental</strong></p>

  <p class="crt2">If we ate only for sustenance, we could probably survive on nutritive pills and water. But we also eat for pleasure. Because we typically eat three times a day, 365 days a year, we enjoy novelty, such as a twist on the traditional construct of a dish. Increasingly, since the 1980s and the advent of “tall” food, chefs have played with the presentation of their ingredients. Since the 1990s, the advent of avant-garde cuisine and so-called molecular gastronomy has seen chefs experiment more and more with both the chemical composition and presentation of dishes as well.</p>

  <p class="crt2"><strong class="calibre1">The Spiritual</strong></p>

  <p class="crt2">The preparation, cooking, and eating of food is a sacrament. Treating it as such has the potential to elevate the quality of our daily lives like nothing else. Several of the world’s leading chefs have worked to perfect each aspect of the dining encounter — from the food and drink to the ambiance to the service — to raise the overall experience to a new level imbued not only with pleasure, comfort, and interest, but also with meaning.</p>

  <p class="sbh"><strong class="calibre1">Choosing a Cooking Technique with Michael Anthony of Gramercy Tavern in New York City</strong></p>

  <p class="sbul1">When we look at an ingredient, we ask, “How can we maximize the inherent flavor or quality of what this is?” As in any other progressive modern kitchen, there is a fascination with examining all the new techniques we can get our hands on. We have used <em class="calibre2">sous vide</em> [i.e., cooking vacuum-packed ingredients at low temperatures for long periods of time], but we are far from letting any technique drive a dish.</p>

  <p class="sbtx">Alice Waters described something cooked via <em class="calibre2">sous vide</em> as “dead” food. I can understand her opinion because she is all about inflecting that “fresh-cut crunch” feeling into her food. <em class="calibre2">Sous vide</em> is all about a long, slow cooking process — and those products calling for that [such as tougher cuts of meat] will be awesome.</p>

  <p class="sbtx">Why we choose any specialized piece of equipment for a dish always gets back to good old-fashioned cooking principles: What is the best way of capturing flavors?</p>

  <p class="sbtx">That is how choosing a technique fits into my cooking.</p>

  <p class="sbtx">I’m excited to eat in restaurants that are pushing the boundaries of presentation and technique. Yet my personal take on food that is too technically driven is that technique comes first and taste comes second. I feel the meals that hit home are ones where the flavor is there and you are eating a meal in a distinct time and place. I love it when people look back on a meal, and the time of year is what made it special. The ingredients they tasted seemed naturally a part of that moment because that is what is available then.</p>

  <p class="sbtx">Sometimes straightforward flavors are the ones people can latch on to, even though the ingredients can be very sophisticated behind the scenes. If, ultimately, the flavor combination is one that is simple and straightforward, with an impressive balance of acidity and bitterness, and you remember it, then you win as a diner. Sometimes the meals that hit home are not the ones that were the most complicated.</p>

  <p class="h">FLAVOR FROM THE INSIDE OUT</p>

  <p class="crt2">America’s foremost chefs reached the pinnacle of their profession through their painstaking attention to every aspect of their cuisine and the restaurant experience. Chefs bring their own unique approaches to their cuisines, which are arguably rooted in either the physical, emotional, mental, or spiritual — although they can span two, three, or even all of them.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">Chefs whose focus celebrates the <strong class="calibre1">physical</strong> realm include <strong class="calibre1">Alice Waters</strong> of Chez Panisse in Berkeley, California, with her pathbreaking focus on the quality of ingredients sourced and served, and <strong class="calibre1">Dan Barber</strong> of Blue Hill at Stone Barns in Pocantico Hills, New York, whose on-premises greenhouse, gardens, and pastures grow and raise much of what the restaurant serves.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">Celebrating the <strong class="calibre1">emotional</strong> realm are those chefs whose cuisines are closely tied to a specific culture, its people, and their traditions. It includes chefs such as <strong class="calibre1">Rick Bayless</strong>, whose Frontera Grill and Topolobampo in Chicago elevate Mexican cuisine, and <strong class="calibre1">Vikram Vij</strong> and <strong class="calibre1">Meeru Dhalwala</strong>, whose Vij’s and Rangoli restaurants in Vancouver honor and celebrate the cooking of India and tap Indian women exclusively to staff their kitchens.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">Easily identifiable as part of the <strong class="calibre1">mental</strong> realm are chefs whose efforts are reconceptualizing how food can be manipulated and presented, such as Chicago’s <strong class="calibre1">Grant Achatz</strong> of Alinea (with signature dishes such as bacon on a clothesline) and <strong class="calibre1">Homaro Cantu</strong> of Moto (whose dishes include incorporating edible paper printed with soy-based inks, and a doughnut soup that looks like eggnog and tastes just like a doughnut).</p>

  <p class="calibre6">Through the elevation not only of their cuisines but of the creation and orchestration of ambiance and service as well, chefs such as <strong class="calibre1">Daniel Boulud</strong> of New York’s Restaurant Daniel and <strong class="calibre1">Patrick O’Connell</strong> of The Inn at Little Washington in Virginia transcend the prior three categories to bring the dining experience to another level in the <strong class="calibre1">spiritual</strong> realm.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">In the pages that follow, we’ll share chefs’ reflections on working in the first three realms. (As for their thoughts on the fourth, we invite you to visit or revisit our book <em class="calibre2">Culinary Artistry.</em>)</p>

  <p class="h1">The Physical Realm</p>

  <p class="crt2"><em class="calibre2">My motto has always been: Find the best ingredients possible, and listen to what they tell you about how they want to be prepared. Mess with them as little as you can. Keep their integrity, but at the same time, focus their flavor, which is where creativity comes in.</em></p>

  <p class="ca"><strong class="calibre1">— VITALY PALEY,</strong> PALEY’S PLACE (PORTLAND, OREGON)</p>

  <p class="crt2">The best chefs work with the best ingredients available to them. The <em class="calibre2">very</em> best chefs don’t settle for this, and seek out even better ingredients through working with foragers, developing relationships with farmers and other purveyors, and even growing their own produce and raising their own animals.</p>

  <p class="crt2"><strong class="calibre1">Monica Pope of T’afia in Houston</strong></p>

  <p class="crt2">My cooking changed radically when we started hosting a farmers’ market [located at T’afia]. I remember when I was cooking in California, and chefs would be waiting for an ingredient to come into season. When it arrived, their philosophy would be “Let’s just slice it and not screw it up.” I thought, “That is just not the way restaurants work.” It’s hard to believe that now I am saying the same thing that they used to say.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">Since the advent of the farmers’ market, when I get a product, it is phenomenal — because it was picked at the right time and has never even been refrigerated before it comes to my door. Sometimes I feel guilty because people will love something, and ask what I did to it. Often the answer is “Very little.”</p>

  <p class="calibre6">Our zucchini salad is a perfect example of celebrating what comes to our door. We get baby zucchini and we shave them raw. Then we add a flavored pecan oil, raw local pecan halves, shaved pecorino cheese, Mexican marigold, and a pinch of salt.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">We also think a lot about the best way to present these ingredients. The salad has to be interesting the whole way through, and I want the customer to have the experience of interacting with it themselves. I want them to have the experience of lifting a shaved piece of cheese after their bite of crunchy yellow or light-green squash. They will see that the salad is dressed with oil, but then have to search and realize that it is pecan oil. Then they will take the next bite and get the herb that has a minty note to it. To achieve this, I will taste a dish night after night to make sure it is “eating” the way I want it to eat.</p>

  <p class="crt2"><strong class="calibre1">Michael Anthony of Gramercy Tavern in New York City</strong></p>

  <p class="crt2">You want to have an infatuation with the ingredients you cook with. You want to tap all the hopes and dreams that went into producing that ingredient. You need to think, “Is this ingredient not only up to par, but is it brilliant?” When it is cooked, you want whoever bites into what you made to think that the flavor is bright, interesting, and delicious.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">I take a simple approach to my food, but simple food does not mean unmanipulated food. Sometimes simple food is simply boring.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">When I cook, I am looking to pull myself back from a dish rather than add to a dish. I would rather a dish feel too simple than too fussy. So, sticking to my core principles, I never want to overload a dish with too many ingredients. But cooking is not always one-two-three. Sometimes you need some extra ingredients as long as they work dynamically.</p>

  <p class="crt2"><strong class="calibre1">Dan Barber of Blue Hill at Stone Barns in Pocantico Hills, New York</strong></p>

  <p class="crt2">Our pork dish starts not at the table with the cut of pork on the plate, but in the field with what kind of pork we choose to raise for our restaurant. I make a lot of decisions to get the most “pigness” out of our pork dish. We raise Berkshire pigs, which have a great flavor. They are an older breed that has a flavor profile that newer breeds don’t have. The pig has a great intramuscular profile that allows it to develop a better flavor.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="art" src="../Images/Art_Pxxii.jpg" class="calibre3"/></p>

  <p class="calibre6">We feed our pigs organic grains and that makes a huge difference. We feed them a wide variety of grains and they forage as well. We are also careful of how much corn the pigs eat. I proved unequivocally this summer the difference feed makes. We had a problem getting organic grain for about eight weeks and had to use conventional grain that has more corn in it because it is cheap to use in the feed. I tasted our pork that was raised exactly the same way side by side with the only change being the feed, and the flavor was as different as night and day. The flavor of the two was so different that a child could tell them apart.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">We also make sure our pigs are slaughtered in a less stressful way. This makes for a calmer pig, and you can see a difference in the meat and taste the difference [in the texture] on the plate.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">At Blue Hill when you order the pork at our restaurant, you don’t know what cut you will be getting. We serve leg, shoulder, rack, loin, and belly; it is a mix on the plate. This makes for a more interesting experience, because you get a variety of flavors and textures. We keep the dish pretty straightforward. We will serve it with Brussels sprout leaves and chickpeas.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">We don’t want to do anything to hide the flavor. We make a pork stock, infuse it with more roasted scraps and bones to make a pork second [also known as a <em class="calibre2">remoulage</em>], then do one more pass with more pork and very little wine. This is water that has been infused with pork three times.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">Depending on the season, I will make an infusion with herbs like a tea and add a little to the sauce if I want to add more flavor. The reason I do an infusion is to make sure the flavor is so light that you don’t even know it is there.</p>

  <p class="h1">The Emotional Realm</p>

  <p class="crt2"><em class="calibre2">I have no professional cooking training. My starting point was, What do I know? I know Indian spices and flavors.</em></p>

  <p class="ca"><strong class="calibre1">— MEERU DHALWALA,</strong> VIJ’S (VANCOUVER)</p>

  <p class="crt2">There are many emotional connections to draw from when creating dishes — from the bounty of a particular country and its historic evolution into a national cuisine, to the classic dishes of that culture, and of the families and even individual cooks within it — as each might bring a unique twist to the standards.</p>

  <p class="crt2"><strong class="calibre1">Maricel Presilla of Cucharamama and Zafra in Hoboken, New Jersey</strong></p>

  <p class="crt2">I’m Cuban — but whether you are Cuban, Venezuelan, Chilean [or another nationality], there is an enormous pride in the flavors of your region and of your childhood. It is like mother’s milk, your first compass. It doesn’t matter how much you travel or how much you expand your palate: You always come back to this notion of basic flavors and ingredients, time and again.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">For me, being a Cuban from eastern Cuba is my anchor. I am from Santiago, which has a very defined cuisine. It is more influenced by the neighboring islands such as Jamaica and Haiti, which both have European influences as well. The cooks from those islands brought flavors with them like allspice, which is not used in the rest of Cuba. My family uses allspice lavishly in our adobo and in other dishes. I use it a lot as well — and it is one of my favorite spices. Our cooking has more complexity than the food of Havana because of these influences.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">We have the most interesting cuisine in the world — and I am not kidding. I have traveled throughout South America, cooking with chefs as well as elderly women, not to mention studying the history of our cuisine from pre-Columbian cooking through the influence of Spanish medieval cooking.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">What is fascinating is that there is a lot of structure to our cooking and clearly defined rules to our seasoning.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">I have learned how all these flavors work in their nationalities and regions, making Latin America my “backyard” of flavor. I am like a painter, and every painter has his or her own palette. I use this analogy because my father was a painter, and there are colors that he would never use that would not be on his palette.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">When I want to be creative, I am comfortable reaching across topographical boundaries. However, I do so with an understanding of all the basic elements of flavor in South American cuisine because I have studied them, eaten them, and lived them!</p>

  <p class="crt2">The three secrets to my cooking? Number one, my wife, Meeru. Number two, treating the spices with integrity. And number three, using local produce as much as possible.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">My own mother is from the northern part of India, so my style and flavors are a combination of different whole and ground spices. I love fenugreek and cinnamon and other aromatics. But one of my [signature dishes] is actually called Mother-in-Law’s Pork Curry, because it is based on a recipe my mother-in-law gave me for stewed meat.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">I wanted to make something new and was talking to Meeru, who told me her mother used to make a curry with lamb, cream, masala, and some other spices and that they loved it. I decided to try it with pork instead of lamb. It was vindaloo style with vinegar, and green onions added right at the end so that they stayed really fresh. There were too many spices in it to list on the menu so it just made sense to name the dish after her instead.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">When I opened my first restaurant, I didn’t have a liquor license and did not want to serve [soda] pop or anything with artificial ingredients or preservatives. I remembered growing up in India and having lemon water with a hint of salt and pepper as a homemade lemonade. [At Vij’s,] we made some lemonade and added a little ginger, a pinch of salt, and sparkling water to give the refreshing effervescence of [soda] pop. We started out serving it with pepper as well, but customers couldn’t get used to seeing black pepper in a drink.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">It is wonderful at the beginning of the meal to refresh your palate.</p>

  <p class="crt2"><strong class="calibre1">Meeru Dhalwala Vij of Vij’s and Rangoli in Vancouver</strong></p>

  <p class="crt2">While working in India for eleven months, I visited Gujarat. Having been raised in the United States, to me “Indian food” was what my mom cooked. I had no idea there were other kinds!</p>

  <p class="calibre6">If you watch a Bollywood movie, you see that the Punjabis and the Gujaratis make a lot of fun of each other. The Gujaratis find us Punjabis very volatile and show-offy. They will say, “Just like your cuisine, you are all fiery and hot!” We Punjabis, on the other hand, think the Gujaratis are quiet and dull. Of course, for me, that has all changed — I love all Indians.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">In Gujarat, at the end of cooking a curry, they would add a teaspoon of sugar and a half a lime. The first time I tasted this, it was awful — but then I found out that the cook of the house was a crappy cook! When I had it done correctly, it was delicious, and had a nice, mellow aftertaste. So, I incorporated lime into my cooking after eating Gujarati food in India.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">My kitchen is staffed by Punjabi women, who had a hard time using lime because it was not part of their cooking in Punjab. When they tasted it, they thought, “Yuck! What’s the point?” Since my Punjabi cooks don’t like lime, this led me to start using kaffir lime. I had more control over the recipes’ flavor because I could just say, “Add 15 leaves to the recipe.” And I learned that turmeric and lime leaf are wonderful together, by the way.</p>

  <p class="h1">The Mental Realm</p>

  <p class="crt2"><em class="calibre2">My menu may read as unusual, but everything is really just a slight flip on a traditional flavor profile. If I pull out one acid, I replace it with another. If I make a</em> tagine <em class="calibre2">traditionally, it will have preserved lemon. Then I’ll ask, “Would it work with lime or orange juice?” It is still the same flavor profile in that it will still have a cutting acid — just maybe not the one that would be used traditionally.</em></p>

  <p class="ca1"><strong class="calibre1">— BRAD FARMERIE,</strong> PUBLIC (NEW YORK CITY)</p>

  <p class="crt2">In modern architecture and design, form is said to follow function. In the cutting-edge world of avant-garde cuisine, which turns classic dishes inside out for the sake of argument or even simple amusement, form follows flavor.</p>

  <p class="crt2"><strong class="calibre1">Homaro Cantu of Moto in Chicago</strong></p>

  <p class="crt2">Moto is not meant to be an everyday experience. Neither is Charlie Trotter’s [also in Chicago] or Daniel [in New York City]. Someone could say that these chefs are just cooking for themselves, and that is true to a certain extent. I am doing this style of [avant-garde] cooking because I am bored with other dishes. If I was all about the customer and just wanted to make people happy, I would cook paella, pizza, and burgers all day. Everyone would have smiles on their faces!</p>

  <p class="calibre6">There is a little bit of selfishness, but there is also playfulness. We have to make sure guests are happy, and that our dishes are both inventive and seasonal. What is happening [in the world] right now is that we are expanding our repertoire of what good food is.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="art" src="../Images/Art_Pxxvi.jpg" class="calibre3"/></p>

  <p class="calibre6">At Moto, when we start out with a concept, flavor is the most important thing but also the last thing we think about. Something might taste great, but who cares? What are <em class="calibre2">we</em> going to do with it? As it pertains to us, we look at a concept. Then it evolves into something where we tweak the flavor a little bit to make it taste more like it “should.” For example, once we wanted to make a cookie with a really concentrated flavor. So, we threw cookies into the dehydrator, and turned them into powder. This created a new building block for flavor. [Instead of the flour you would normally use in your dough,] you weigh the powdered cookies out as your starch in your normal cookie recipe. But this starch is now a carrier of flavor for the end product — so the resulting cookie now tastes more like it “should” than it would have just using regular flour.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">A lot of our food is rooted in classic combinations — and it has to be. Why? The process by which we go about creating is so foreign that we have to make something that you are familiar with eating. In a tapas restaurant, you have had generations of trial and error to create a dish through local ingredients and techniques that have evolved into something that tastes good. For example, olives marinated with garlic and parsley has been around for a hundred years. Now, there is nothing wrong with that. But, for us, the idea of marinating olives with garlic and parsley is not fun. So, we are going to make a dish where the olives are actually the parsley and the garlic is the olives and so on. But it tastes like something you’d want.</p>

  <p class="crt2"><strong class="calibre1">What’s in a Pancake?</strong> Yes, we do serve real food. We got some BLiS syrup [handcrafted aged maple syrup] in the kitchen which is used by other top chefs around the country. This stuff is liquid gold! This syrup is aged in small bourbon barrels in Canada and is $20 for a small [375 ml] bottle. The maker even hand-stamps each bottle with wax and writes the label by hand. When we got it in, we knew we had to do something with it.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">We decided to make a pancake dish. We started with the question “How can we make this dish taste more like pancakes than pancakes?” So, we pureed cooked pancakes, then adjusted the liquid with milk. The cool thing about making a pancake puree out of cooked pancakes is that you can alter the concentration levels. You can’t alter the concentration levels when you are making straight pancakes.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">We wanted to trick the customer into thinking that they were going to eat a hot pancake topped with this syrup. Believability is so important in the process, so we even execute the dish in front of them [in the dining room]. We bring out a metal plate that looks hot [but is frozen and steaming from being immersed in nitrogen]. The pancake batter is then shot from a syringe. The batter freezes when it hits the metal. When we serve it, we top it with the BLiS syrup. Ninety-nine percent of the people who were served this dish swore they were getting a hot flapjack, and it was only when they tasted it that they learned it was cold.</p>

  <p class="crt2"><strong class="calibre1">Contrarian by Nature</strong> People want to say that wine is natural and has been around a thousand years. But is it natural or unnatural? We don’t know. You have people in a foreign country stepping all over these grapes, putting foot fungus in there, and then creating a fermented thing that is controlled. I don’t think that wine is all that natural! Every time you turn on the blender and puree something, you are crossing the line of natural versus unnatural. Nature did not intend for an electric motor to spin a blade and turn a solid into a liquid.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">If you think an unripe green tomato tastes better than a ripe heirloom red tomato picked off the vine in August, then by all means eat the green tomato. That is flavor preference. What if I feed you an unripe green tomato but alter its taste so it tastes <em class="calibre2">better</em> than a vine-ripened red tomato? When we pick it off the vine earlier, it has a different quality — it is sharper. So, we will pair something that maybe should not go with it, like Parmesan cheese pureed with butter. This will make it a little richer and compensate for the overtannic, overacidic qualities of the tomato. [If you enjoy it,] then you have succumbed to not following the seasons.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">In the same manner, we’ll serve a dish of unripe things that taste ripe because they are together! What do I prefer? Of course I prefer the vine-ripened tomato at the end of August. We would make the other dish just to ask the question.</p>

  <p class="crt2"><strong class="calibre1">Creating New Flavors</strong> I disagree with the notion that there are no new flavors. Maybe there are no new products, even though we don’t know everything that exists in the sea. To create a new flavor, all you have to do is dissect an ingredient. For example, if I take an avocado and put it into a centrifuge, we would separate the fat and the water. The water will carry the avocado taste. If I take that water and create a snow with it or make it into a pill, it will have a much different taste than avocado, because avocado is thought of as something that is rich. But there would be no richness here; it is a completely different product. We just made up a new flavor.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">So now if I want to mimic an avocado, I would have to serve something rich with it. I could serve something dairy with it, like brown butter. I now have something that would go with a classical turbot dish with brown butter and capers, whereas fresh avocado would not have paired up with that dish very well.</p>

  <p class="sbh"><strong class="calibre1">How to Lengthen Flavors</strong></p>

  <p class="ep1"><em class="calibre2">Think of something in its pure form like passion fruit puree: It is strong, vibrant, and when it touches your tongue, you taste it [all at once]. I learned from Heston Blumenthal [chef of The Fat Duck, the Michelin three-star restaurant in England] that if you take that same passion fruit and make it into a gelée and cube it, then you will get the flavor little by little as the cube melts on your palate. The flavor release takes longer and lasts longer in your mouth.</em></p>

  <p class="ca"><strong class="calibre1">— JOHNNY IUZZINI,</strong> PASTRY CHEF, JEAN GEORGES (NEW YORK CITY)</p>

  <p class="sbul1"><em class="calibre2">Sometimes we try to lengthen flavors, like you have with some wines [e.g., wines that are said to have “a long finish” that you taste long after swallowing]. I will think, “How long do I want a flavor to last? Do I want a blast, or do I want it to linger?”</em></p>

  <p class="sbtx"><em class="calibre2">We make a dish of a fried oyster with shiso and a wasabi, yuzu, and sancho pepper [also known as Szechuan pepper] sauce. That is a great way to experience length of flavor. The shiso wraps around the oyster like a taco shell. When you take a bite, you get the herbaceous punch from the shiso, then richness from the fried oyster that coats your tongue. Then you get the acid from the yuzu on the sides of your tongue. When you swallow the bite, the wasabi comes up the back of your nose. Then you get a small surprise because the pepper gives you a numbing effect across your palate. This is not a “two seconds of heaven” bite; we are talking about a twenty-second experience. We have orchestrated this not in a crazy chemical way, but just by playing with an oyster.</em></p>

  <p class="sbtx"><em class="calibre2">The cues come from the wine world: Sometimes you want bright and spritzy high-acid flavor, and other times you want something rich and long.</em></p>

  <p class="crt2"><strong class="calibre1">Katsuya Fukushima of minibar in Washington, DC</strong></p>

  <p class="crt2">I like to work with classic, preexisting flavor combinations that people can recognize. They may not recognize anything from the textures I use, but they will find recognition in the flavors.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">To make our “Philly Cheesesteak,” we start with the bread. We put pita dough through a pasta machine so that it gets really thin, but puffs way up when you cook it. For the cheese element, we use a Vermont and Wisconsin cheddar cheese mousse that we pipe into the pita. For the beef, we serve seared Kobe beef. For the onions, we spread on caramelized onion puree. We then top that with truffles. So you have bread, cheese, beef, and onion, just like a Philly cheesesteak. We add the truffles just to push it over the top.</p>

  <p class="h">CHEFS’ STRATEGIES FOR BALANCING FLAVORS</p>

  <p class="crt2"><em class="calibre2">On every forkful — regardless of what’s on the fork — there has to be salt, acid, and heat. . . . However, unless you are serving a pepper-crusted dish, or a lemon or vinegar dish, your seasoning should never be detected. Instead, your beans should taste like beans, and your rabbit should taste like rabbit. Diners don’t need to know how much salt, acid, and heat are in the dish — and none should be obvious. You’ll also have minor supporting players in a dish, such as the aromatic or</em> picante <em class="calibre2">levels that might come from your mirepoix or</em> sofrito <em class="calibre2">[a well-cooked sauce of tomatoes, garlic, onions, and herbs] or whatever else went in there. But when a diner tastes your dishes, all you want them to be thinking about is those beans, or that rabbit.</em></p>

  <p class="ca"><strong class="calibre1">— SHARON HAGE,</strong> YORK STREET (DALLAS)</p>

  <p class="crt2">Over the past fifteen years, we have interviewed many chefs in an effort to understand how some of America’s best chefs approach creating great food. What we learned is that there are as many approaches as chefs themselves. While some strategies overlap, others are unique and display strong self-knowledge as to what makes their individual cuisines so original and compelling.</p>

  <p class="crt2"><strong class="calibre1">Traci Des Jardins of Jardinière in San Francisco</strong></p>

  <p class="crt2">The most important aspect of any dish is balance — between acid, fat, salt, and sweetness. It is the key to making food taste good.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">The same is true in pastry. I am constantly working with my pastry chef when I taste desserts with her. I will taste something and say it is too sweet — that it is missing the acid balance, and needs some fat and a little salt. Using salt in pastry brings out the flavor, just as it does in savory food. When it comes to dessert, people think more in a “monochromatic” sweet fashion. But sweets need balance, too.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">My favorite flavor is the harmony of these elements working together, whether it is sweet or savory.</p>

  <p class="crt2"><strong class="calibre1">Marcel Desaulniers of The Trellis in Williamsburg, Virginia</strong></p>

  <p class="crt2">My cooking philosophy has always been simple: Don’t complicate things, and let the food speak for itself. I want the food to leave a clean taste in your mouth, and that goes for savory food as well as desserts.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">We don’t use a lot of spices because they can have an intensity of flavor that can overwhelm other flavors. People can’t restrain themselves with certain ingredients — and, often, it’s garlic. At The Trellis, we use garlic in only one recipe: a dressing that has been on the menu for twenty-six years. Herbs can be overused as well, too. Rosemary and basil, which I love, are constantly overused, which results in a bitter flavor.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">I tell cooks, “When in doubt, don’t use it.” The food you are starting with already has its own intrinsic flavor, whether it is a scallop or a filet of beef. Whatever you do to embellish the flavor should be a very minor part of the relationship, rather than sharing the stage fifty-fifty.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">I thought of myself as a saucier from my days in New York, yet when I opened this restaurant in Williamsburg, it was not the way I wanted to present the food. Rather than sauces, I wanted to use vegetables and fruits as the accompaniments. They provide moisture as a natural component and they work on the plate, but not as a fifty-fifty partner.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">An example of where fruit works great as a component is on our pork dish: We serve pork loin medallions, grilled sausage, sweet potatoes, tender cooked string beans, and bourbon-glazed peaches. So this is a dish with no sauce, except the juice from the peaches.</p>

  <p class="crt2"><strong class="calibre1">Carrie Nahabedian of Naha in Chicago</strong></p>

  <p class="crt2">You should always season something right from the start, and not just at the end. If you just add salt and pepper at the end, you are not doing a soup justice. You want those flavors to blossom.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">Take our butternut squash soup as an example. We start our soup with hefty pieces of slab bacon, so we are already starting off with a lot of flavor. From there, we add the mirepoix and make sure it gets nice and caramelized. Then we start adding our salt, fresh-cracked pepper, and thyme sprig.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">Next, we add roasted squash. The reason we roast it before it goes in the soup is because you can taste what state the squash is in. It may need a little help because it needed to age a couple more weeks in the cellar before we got it, so we may add a garnet yam. Now, we taste the soup and decide what kind of sweetness to add. That could be honey, molasses, or maple sugar — not just [white] sugar.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">Next, we puree the soup and pass it [through a fine-mesh strainer] to achieve its smooth texture.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">To the soup base, we add the garnishes. We already have bacon, but some smoked duck will be good, too. We add spaghetti squash and fried parsnips for additional texture and, in the case of the parsnips, sweetness as well. For a last note, we add a drizzle of maple syrup or barrel-aged sherry. These things just seal the soup so that the flavors all escalate. It is important to not rush things so that your flavors come together.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="art" src="../Images/Art_Pxxx.jpg" class="calibre3"/></p>

  <p class="crt2"><strong class="calibre1">Andrew Carmellini of A Voce in New York City</strong></p>

  <p class="crt2">Any kind of sauce boils down to acid, salt, sweetness, and two kinds of spice: savory spice, meaning cumin- or coriander-type spices, and heat spice, meaning chiles or pepper flakes. You can be making a vinaigrette or a Thai curry or a bouillabaisse, but its seasoning involves the same principles on the palate. As long as you can manipulate those things, you can get your palate excited.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">If something is heavy or fatty on the tongue, add some vinegar or lemon or another type of acid. If you were making a Thai-style coconut curry that is too fatty and rich from the coconut milk, you would add some grated lime zest, lime juice, and a splash of fish sauce to cut the richness.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">When you are adjusting the seasoning of a dish, you need to think about its origin. That is why traveling is so important. For example, you wouldn’t use rice wine vinegar in a French bouillabaisse, but you might use a little bit of chili flakes. You must understand the historical context of a dish, which is why you wouldn’t thicken an Indian curry with strawberries.</p>

  <p class="crt2"><strong class="calibre1">Sharon Hage of York Street in Dallas</strong></p>

  <p class="crt2">When I am building a dish, I use a tray we call “the four seasons,” which is <em class="calibre2">fleur de sel</em> [salt]; red pepper flakes, the ultimate marriage of heat and fruit; dry mustard, which I use all the time; and sumac, which is an acidic component.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">When I make a dish, it starts with the dry ingredients first, and the salt is the first dry ingredient. Then I add the heat layer, such as a jalapeño or horseradish. Then I add acid: lemon juice, vinegar, <em class="calibre2">verjus</em>, or all three. Then, at the last second, I add the fat component — the oil or butter — to the sauce, which brings it all together.</p>

  <p class="crt2"><strong class="calibre1">Brad Farmerie of Public in New York City</strong></p>

  <p class="crt2">When I come up with a new dish, I am looking at two things: The first is building up the richness, and the second is cutting that richness with acidity, spice, or herbaceousness.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">I start by thinking, What is the rich component? How can I build richness? If it is a protein, we may cure the meat or fry the fish. If it is a vegetarian dish, I may start with eggplant, which is meaty, so I will build it up with miso or tahini, which will make it even richer and meatier. This is really important in a vegetarian dish, because I hate those flimsy veg plates of grilled vegetables and a lot of salad!</p>

  <p class="calibre6">Texture is another way of building richness. If you add miso or tahini, that adds richness and texture. An emulsification also gives a sense of richness in your mind and across your palate. One way to add rich texture in a “fakey-jakey” way is to add palm sugar. It is [a less] sweet sugar, and we will shave it into a dish halfway through the cooking and temper it with tamarind. We use it so subtly that you don’t even know it is there.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">Now that I have my richness, the question becomes, “How can we cut that richness so it is light on the palate and in the belly?” We use a tremendous amount of acid, but it is always in check with what is on the plate. Choosing the right acid or herb will leave a light feeling on the palate and cut a rich dish.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">With any fried food, you need a big zap of acidity to get through it. With fried fish, we will use preserved lemon, yogurt, or yuzu with a white soy dipping sauce.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">Cured meat is almost the epitome of richness. Cured meats have a salinity to them, and quite often there is sugar to balance the salt as well. You need some punchy flavors to cut the meat, or it will just be heavy on the palate. Traditionally, you would use capers or caper berries. Mustard fruits [known in Italy as <em class="calibre2">mostarda,</em> these are fruits preserved in mustard-flavored sweet syrup] are another traditional approach. I like them because you have the added element of spice. We make our own mustard fruits and bastardize them a little by using kumquats, baby apricots, and gooseberries, which are not traditional in Italy. These fruits simply have beautiful flavor and color. The other thing we do is use whole mustard seeds. Mustard fruits are typically [made through] a refined process in that they become like a clear jam. We leave ours a little rougher and fold in a little dry mustard in the end to make the colors of the citrus fruits really pop.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">Another way we cut richness is by using sweet-and-sour poached vegetables and fruit. We’ll poach fennel or pearl onions in a sweet-sour liquid with licorice and star anise. The family of apples, pears, and quince also holds up very well, as do sour poached plums.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">I like aromatic spices [for their ability to cut richness]. If I’m working on a dish inspired by India, my inspirations are the flavors of clove, cardamom, and coriander seed. They are aromatic spices that really cut the fat of a dish, so the dish is not big, fat, and flabby on the palate. Fresh turmeric gives you fruitiness and upfront flavor with a touch of acid that perks up a dish. If you add fresh turmeric to your curry, you will make a world of difference by adding this one small thing.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">If I’m working on a dish inspired by Southeast Asia, I like galangal, lemongrass, and ginger. They all have natural acidity and zingy spice that will perk up anything. Even if you are not adding acid to coconut milk but just adding aromatics, it won’t taste heavy.</p>

  <p class="crt2"><strong class="calibre1">Emily Luchetti, pastry chef at Farallon in San Francisco</strong></p>

  <p class="crt2">I want my flavors to be clean, crisp, accentuated, and distinguished. From there, I look at what I feel like making. If I have peaches, do I want to make a trifle or a napoleon or something else? What is the star of the plate? Is it one thing and everything else is going to be showing it off? Or are there two main flavors that are both going to have equal billing? I make a peach-blueberry trifle that has a mascarpone cream and is pretty intense. It is one of my favorite summer things to make. The peaches and blueberries are both the stars. If you make a pumpkin-cranberry upside-down cake, the pumpkin is the star and the cranberry is an accent.</p>

  <p class="img"><img alt="art" src="../Images/Art_Pxxxii.jpg" class="calibre3"/></p>

  <p class="calibre6">You have to look at the ingredient and ask, “How am I going to bring out the best of its flavors? Do I cook it, or leave it alone? Does this piece of fruit need to be intensified because it wants to be the star, or is it not good enough on its own?” When you are working with fresh or dried fruit, the most important thing is the balance of sugar, salt, and lemon. If I am mixing fresh fruit for a shortcake or crisp, I always add some lemon juice and salt, because — just like in savory cooking — it helps bring out the flavor. We are talking a half teaspoon to a teaspoon of lemon and a large pinch of kosher salt.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">Whenever you are cooking fruit with sugar to serve with something, taste the fruit first. If it is the peak of summer, that fruit may not need sugar. If you added some anyway, it would dull the flavors and make it taste too sweet. So, taste your fruit — and trust your palate! People trust their palates for savory food all the time. They’ll taste a tomato sauce and know it needs some salt. You need to trust your palate for sugar as well. You know when something is too sugary or salty.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">When you are working with fresh fruit, the fruit has to be the guide. If you eat a piece of fresh fruit by itself, it is a dessert. So you want the dessert, in the end, to taste better than the fruit itself. To do that, you need to add things that go naturally. Blueberries and peaches go well together. Vanilla goes with practically any fruit. Almonds go with most fruits because they are light nuts that have a lot of flavor but not a lot of fat. Just starting with things that naturally go together, you will have a greater rate of success.</p>

  <p class="calibre6">People will read that I think three flavors work in a dessert — then they’ll say, “Well, you used <em class="calibre2">four.</em> . . .” That is not the point — the point is knowing when to stop! Too many chefs start adding things that in the end all taste muddled, because nothing can stand out on its own. When you are more restrictive, each thing tastes good on its own — and the dessert becomes more than the sum of its parts. It is hard to know when to stop. Many chefs seem to think, “Oh, I’ll just add this dot of mango. . . .” Well, the taste of that one acidic dot can set the whole dessert off.</p>

  <p class="spb">Flavor is a “language” that anyone who loves the pleasures of the palate will find to be well worth mastering. Once you master the language of flavor, you can use it to communicate — and become a better cook.</p>
